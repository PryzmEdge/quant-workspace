# Markdown Architecture — CLAUDE.md

> **Scope**: Structural navigation and identity only. Hard constraints live in hooks. Schema contracts live in `_config/stage-contract.py`. See `docs/v10-draft.md` for the current engineering position paper.

---

## Workspace Identity

This is the **Markdown Architecture** workspace — a research and AI-native DevOps environment structured with the Interpretable Context Methodology (ICM). The thesis: Markdown is a human-readable orchestration substrate, not an execution environment. Every stage is a self-contained unit with explicit Inputs, Process, and Outputs declared in a `CONTEXT.md` file.

## Navigation Rules

- **Load stage context by section, not full file.** Reference only the section you need from a `CONTEXT.md` (Inputs, Process, or Outputs).
- **Never load full `domain-rules.md`.** Load the `## Constraints` section only.
- **Stage promotion requires `operator_approved: true`** in the stage's YAML frontmatter before writing to the next stage's `output/` directory.
- **Do not write to `output/`** of any stage until the current stage's acceptance criteria are GREEN.

---

## Required YAML Frontmatter (every .md artifact)

```yaml
---
status: draft | review | approved
operator_approved: false
risk_check_passed: false
stage: "00-intake" | "01-research" | "02-analysis" | "03-output"
---
```

---

## What Belongs Here vs. Elsewhere

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| File paths, build commands | CLAUDE.md (here) ✅ |
| Schema field definitions | `_config/stage-contract.py` ✅ |
| Hard constraints | `.claude/settings.json` hooks ✅ |
| Domain-specific constraints | `_config/domain-rules.md` ✅ |
| Behavioral rules | **Not here** — use hooks ❌ |

---

## Build Commands

```bash
# Parallel build (required — sequential is slow)
make -j$(nproc) all

# Single stage
make stage=02-analysis

# Validate a stage output before promotion
python _config/stage-contract.py --stage 02-analysis
```

---

## Skills

Load on demand — do not load all skills on every turn:

- `domain-validator` — validate stage artifacts against `domain-rules.md`
- `context-compiler` — assemble token-budgeted context from stage inputs
- `audit-logger` — write `PromptExecutionReceipt` to the append-only log
